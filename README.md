## Description
Online casinos have several problems that can be solved by using blockchain technology. These include a lack of transparency and fairness, dependence on central authorities, difficulty in verifying the outcomes of games, and lack of integration with web3 digital assets.

Web3 slot machines aim to provide users with a more secure and transparent gaming experience by using blockchain technology to record and verify all transactions. Additionally, the use of smart contracts allows for automatic and decentralized execution of the game's rules, so players do not have to rely on a central authority to ensure that the game is being played fairly. Furthermore, web3 slot machines can be easily integrated with web3 digital assets such as tokens and NFTs.

Web3 slot machines can potentially tap into the large and growing global gambling market, which is expected to reach $876 billion by 2026. By offering a secure, transparent, and decentralized gaming experience, web3 slot machines can appeal to a broad audience, including gamblers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

To play a web3 slot machine, a user must first buy a chest (loot box) from the marketplace. The user can then open the chest to reveal its contents, which may include chips of different sizes. The user can use these chips to play the slot machine, with the size of the chip influencing the win chance and score. The score will be registered on the leaderboard contract, and the user can sell any chests and chips won in the marketplace to cash out. The chips used in the game will be sent to the treasury, where they will be wrapped into new chests.
